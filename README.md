# Bitcoin Tracker

An iOS app written in **Swift**, built in a **VIPER** based architecture, that displays a 3 week chart of the bitcoin market price. The chart is displayed using **CocoaPods** and the [Charts Pod](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts), with data coming from the Blockchain API. Requests are done using **Rest API URL Session requests** and the data is parsed into **Codable Structs**. 

**XCUnitTests** and **mocks** are included for all the files in the project.
